## ⚠️Attention⚠️
This is an **unofficial** implementation of paper "Frozen Language Model Helps ECG Zero-Shot Learning", I **have not** trained and tested on datasets such as PTB-XL. 

This repository should be considered as a reproduction of the overall framework and ideas of the paper, rather than a verification of the results.
